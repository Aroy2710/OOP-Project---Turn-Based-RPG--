11/10/2025 - Resolved bug with warrior ultimate skill not taking health into consideration for damage

Bug Location - Warrior.cpp , line 55 - 58
What caused the bug = The if conditional for considering health was below 50% was coded incorrectly
Fix : Created a max health that stores default health at the time of instantiation and used that to compare current health.

21/10/25 - Fixed bug that caused every player input for archetype, class selection and enemy selection to become an infinite loop
if a non numeric input was entered.

Bug Location - GameManager.cpp
What caused the bug - Everytime player  gave a non numeric input, it would be stored in the input buffer and treated as the input for the next iteration
Fix - Introduced a check for non numeric inputs where if the input is non numeric, it would be cleared from the input buffer.
